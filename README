This little program calculates how far forward the rear of a rack
deck needs to be put so that an infinitely tall  rectangular bag
placed on it will not foul your handlebars.

usage: deckoffset [-f] [-s stack(mm)] HTA(degrees) ht length(mm) [ stem(mm) ]

It subtracts (ht length + stack) * cos(hta) from the stem length;
if the stem length is not supplied, it assumes 100mm; if the stack
isn't provided, it assumes 35mm.   This program does not fudge the
stem length for a handlebar gap, but it assumes a horizontal stem.


The calculation this program does is

stem-length - (cos(hta) * (ht length + stack))

with some sanity checking against hta (it won't allow < 60 degrees),
ht length (it won't allow < 30mm) or stem length (won't allow < 30mm),
though you can force it to not do sanity checks by passing the -f option.
